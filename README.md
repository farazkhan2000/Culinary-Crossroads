# 🌍 Culinary Crossroads

*A digital feast connecting cultures through authentic recipes and stories*

## 🎓 The Story

Culinary Crossroads was born from a collaboration between five Master's students from different departments at the University of Jyväskylä. United by our passion for cultural exchange and technology, we set out to create a platform that celebrates global culinary diversity.

As a multicultural team speaking 12+ languages, we understand the power of food as a universal language. Our project combines technical expertise with cultural research to bring authentic recipes and stories from around the world to your kitchen.
